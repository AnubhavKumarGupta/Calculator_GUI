# Simple Calculator Application

## Overview
This is a simple calculator application built in Python using the `tkinter` module for the graphical user interface (GUI). The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Getting Started
To run the calculator, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Simply copy and paste the provided code into a Python script file (e.g., `calculator.py`) and execute the script.

```bash
python calculator.py
```

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Clear button (`C`) to reset the display.
- Error handling for cases like division by zero.

## How to Use
1. Enter numbers using the numeric buttons (`0` to `9`).
2. Use the arithmetic operation buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform calculations.
3. Press the `=` button to see the result.
4. Use the `C` button to clear the display.

## Dependencies
This calculator script requires Python and the `tkinter` module, which is a standard GUI toolkit for Python.

## Notes
- Make sure to handle mathematical expressions carefully to avoid errors.
- Division by zero will result in an "Error" message.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs. Enjoy calculating!
